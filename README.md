# Shopify Monthly Summary Dashboard

As the owner of a Shopify store, the business owner expressed a desire to increase profits by focusing on selling more. However, when asked about leveraging past performance data, he admitted to not paying attention to insights from the previous year, highlighting a gap in data-driven decision-making. He recognizes the need for someone who can analyze historical trends, translate those insights into actionable strategies, and provide business recommendations that enable smarter, more calculated decisions for long-term growth.
To support this, the owner provided sales data detailing all items sold and their associated revenue for the first two quarters of 2025.

## Business Recommendation: 

### 1. Prioritize Electronics for New Customer Acquisition   
Insight: Electronics was the most profitable category, with 41.98% of its purchases made by new customers.   
Recommendation:
- Focus digital marketing efforts (ads, email campaigns) on Electronics to attract new customers.
- Introduce first-time buyer incentives specifically for Electronics products.
- Use product bundles (e.g., Electronics + Accessories) to increase average order value.
 <br/>
                   
### 2. Upsell and Cross-Sell to Returning Customers   
Insight: Returning customers purchased more frequently and in higher quantities, but mainly bought lower-margin items such as Accessories.   
Recommendation:
- Use email campaigns and personalized recommendations to upsell high-margin items to loyal customers.
- Offer exclusive bundles or loyalty rewards to encourage repeat purchases of premium categories like Electronics.
- Segment top-performing returning customers and target them with higher-value promotions.
 <br/>    
           
### 3. Improve Customer Retention     
Insight: The number of returning customers declined by 16.7%, despite their higher average spend.      
Recommendation:
- Implement post-purchase email automation to re-engage past buyers.
- Run win-back campaigns targeting customers who haven’t returned in 30–60 days.
- Gather feedback from existing customers to uncover potential friction points or dissatisfaction.
 <br/>
                 
### 4. Leverage Time-Based Purchase Patterns     
Insight: New customers tend to purchase earlier in the month, while returning customers are more active later in the month.     
Recommendation:
- Launch marketing campaigns and new customer offers during the first week of each month.
- Introduce loyalty promotions or exclusive discounts mid-to-late month to drive returning customer activity.
 <br/>
                   
### 5. Optimize Accessory Sales for Profit      
Insight: Accessories generated the highest order volume (36% of items sold) but contributed less to overall revenue than Electronics.      
Recommendation:
- Promote Accessories as add-on items or threshold boosters (e.g., “Free shipping on orders with 2+ accessories”).
- Consider bundling Accessories with high-margin products to improve profit per transaction.
- Review pricing and supplier costs to ensure margins on Accessories remain sustainable.
<br/>   
                    
### 6. Track and Reduce Customer Churn     
Insight: There is a visible decline in returning customers, and churn patterns appear across key product categories.      
Recommendation:
- Send personalized reactivation emails offering time-limited discounts or relevant product suggestions based on their purchase history.
